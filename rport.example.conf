[client]
## rportd server address.
## Mandatory IP address and port divided by a colon.
server = "0.0.0.0:8080"

## fingerprint string to perform host-key validation against the server's public key
## Highly recommended. Not using it is a big security risk.
#fingerprint = "36:98:56:12:f3:dc:e5:8d:ac:96:48:23:b6:f0:42:15"

## An optional username and password (client authentication) in the form: "<user>:<password>".
## Highly recommended. Required if client authentication is enabled on the rport server.
auth = "user1:1234"

## An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be used to reach the rport server.
## Authentication can be specified inside the URL
#proxy = "http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081"

## An optional client ID to better identify the client.
## If not set, a random id will be crated that changes on every client start.
## The server rejects connections on duplicated ids.
#id = "somestring"

## An optional client name to better identify the client.
## Useful if you use numeric ids to make client identification easier.
#name = "my_win_vm_1"

## An optional list of tags to give your clients attributes.
## Used for filtering clients on the server.
#tags = ['win', 'server', 'vm']

## Optional remote connections tunneled through the server, each of which come in the form:
##   <local-port>
##   or
##   <remote-port>:<local-port>
##   or
##   <remote-port>:<local-interface>:<local-port>
##   Examples:
##   1)  remotes = ['22']
##       Makes the local port 22 available on a random port of the rport server.
##   2)  remotes = ['2222:127.0.0.1:22'] or shorthand
##       remotes = ['2222:22']
##       Makes the local SSH port 22 available on port 2222 of the rport server.
##   3)  remotes = ['9999:192.168.1.1:80']
##       Makes the Port 80 of 192.168.1.1 available on port 9999 of the rport server.
## sharing <remote-host>:<remote-port> from the client to the server's <local-interface>:<local-port>.
## If not set, client connects without active tunnel(s) waiting for tunnels to be initialized by the server.
## Multiple remotes must be comma separated. Using linebreaks after the comma is possible.
#remotes = [
#  '3389:3389',
#  '5050'
#]

## There is no technical requirement to run the rport client under the root user.
## Running it as root is an unnecessary security risk.
## Rport exits with an error if started as root unless you explicitly allow it.
## Defaults to false, ignored on Windows.
#allow_root = false

[connection]
  ## An optional keepalive interval. You must specify a time with a unit, for example '30s' or '2m'.
  ## Defaults to '0s' (disabled)
  keep_alive = '30s'

  ## Maximum number of times to retry before exiting. Defaults to unlimited (-1)
  #max_retry_count = 10

  ## Maximum wait time before retrying after a disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes
  max_retry_interval = '5m'

  ## Optionally set the 'Host' header (defaults to the host found in the server url)
  #hostname = "myvm1.lan"

  ## Other custom headers in the form "HeaderName: HeaderContent"
  #headers = ['User-Agent: test1', 'Authorization: Basic XXXXXX']

[logging]
  ## Specifies log file path for global logging
  ## Not setting "log_file" turns logging off.
  #log_file = 'C:\Program Files\rport\rport.log'
  log_file = "/var/log/rport/rport.log"

  ## Specify log level. Values: 'error', 'info', 'debug'.
  ## Defaults to 'error'
  log_level = "error"

[remote-commands]
  ## Enable or disable execution of remote commands sent by server.
  ## Defaults: true
  #enabled = true

  ## Limit the maximum length of the command output that is sent back to server.
  ## Applies to the stdout and stderr separately.
  ## If exceeded {send_back_limit} bytes are sent.
  ## Defaults: 2048
  #send_back_limit = 2048

  ## Allow commands matching the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {deny}.
  ## Defaults: ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']
  #allow = ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']

  ## Deny commands matching one of the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {allow}.
  ## With the below default filter only single commands are allowed.
  ## Defaults: ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']
  #deny = ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']

  ## Order: ['allow','deny'] or ['deny','allow']. Order of which filter is applied first.
  ## Defaults: ['allow','deny']
  ##
  ## order: ['allow','deny']
  ## First, all allow directives are evaluated; at least one must match, or the command is rejected.
  ## Next, all deny directives are evaluated. If any matches, the command is rejected.
  ## Last, any commands which do not match an allow or a deny directive are denied by default.
  ## Example:
  ## allow: ['^/usr/bin/.*']
  ## deny: ['^/usr/bin/zip']
  ## All commands in /usr/bin except '/usr/bin/zip' can be executed. Full path must be used.
  ##
  ## order: ['deny','allow']
  ## First, all deny directives are evaluated; if any match,
  ## the command is denied UNLESS it also matches an allow directive.
  ## Any command which do not match any allow or deny directives are permitted.
  ## Example:
  ## deny: ['.*']
  ## allow: ['zip$']
  ## All commands are denied except those ending in zip.
  ##
  #order = ['allow','deny']
