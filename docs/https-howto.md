# Securing the Rportd API with HTTPS
Rportd supports HTTPS without the need for a reverse proxy.
Open the `rportd.conf` file and enter the path to a certificate or certificate chain and a server key. The key must not be password protected.

```
[api]
  ## Defines the IP address and port the API server listens on
  ## specify non-empty {address} to enable API support
  address = "0.0.0.0:3000"
  ## ..snip ...snap
  ## If both cert_file and key_file are specified, then rportd will use them to serve the API with https.
  ## Intermediate certificates should be included in cert_file if required.
  cert_file = "/etc/rport/server.crt"
  key_file = "/etc/rport/server.key"
```

If the IP address of your server has a public domain name you can generate a free certificate quite easily using Let's encrypt. 

Make sure no other software is using the TCP port 80 during the certificate generation and your firewall is not blocking access to TCP 80.

```
apt install certbot
certbot certonly -d <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME> -n --agree-tos --standalone -m <YOUR_EMAIL>
chgrp rport /etc/letsencrypt/archive/
chmod g+rx /etc/letsencrypt/archive/
chgrp rport /etc/letsencrypt/live/
chmod g+rx /etc/letsencrypt/live/
chgrp rport /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/
chmod g+rx /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/
chgrp rport /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/privkey1.pem
chmod g+rx /etc/letsencrypt/archive/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/privkey1.pem
chgrp rport /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/
```

This will create the server key, certificates, and chains in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/`.
Note that the files and folders generated by certbot are readable only by root. So change your ownerships accordingly.

Now set up your `rportd.conf` like this.

```
[api]
  ## Defines the IP address and port the API server listens on
  ## specify non-empty {address} to enable API support
  address = "0.0.0.0:3000"
  ## ..snip ...snap
  ## If both cert_file and key_file are specified, then rportd will use them to serve the API with https.
  ## Intermediate certificates should be included in cert_file if required.
  cert_file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/fullchain.pem"
  key_file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/privkey.pem"
```

Restart rportd after any changes to the configuration file. Check your SSL setup is working properly by executing `curl -Iv -u admin:foobaz https://<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>:3000/api/v1/status`. You should not get any errors.

On Ubuntu a cron to renew the certificates is created on the installation of the certbot package. On other distribution you might set up a cron executing `certbot -q renew` manually.
